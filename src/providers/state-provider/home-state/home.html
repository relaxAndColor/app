<p> Sometimes people need to just relax and unwind. One way to do this that is all the rage right now are adult coloring books.
  Coloring in complicated designs allows you to turn your brain off to the outside world and simply let your creative mind flow. That can be as soothing as forms of meditation.
  It gives you the feeling of being able to act like a kid again and come up with an artistic, eye pleasing, colorful piece that only you yourself thought of.
  It doesn't require much of a effort but in a world where time is money, some people might just might not be able to find the time in their day to sit down a slowly fill in a page.

This app is designed to make that time available for people who still want that relaxing feeling that people get from working on coloring books for adults.
It is meant to bring the coloring book to your screen so you can color anytime or anywhere in quick fashion but still get the satisfaction of creating a colorful
picture from a blank canvas. Instead of having to color in every dot and worry about going outside the lines (which I hate) you will be able to simply click on a
certain color and then click the area of the image where you want that color to be filled in. </p>
